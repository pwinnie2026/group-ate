Nellie Nguyen, Kiana Tran, Paige Wu

### About this project
This project investigates access to varying food options for college transfer students, specifically students attending the University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA). This "mapplication" aims to survey UCLA transfer students whether they currently live on-campus (through UCLA dorms), off-campus (including UCLA university apartments (UA's, frats/sororities, and private apartments), or commute. Our goal is to uplift transfer student voices in discussions over the food options they have available. Mapped locations will cover food options on the Hill, on campus, and off-campus (Westwood). Students can comment on their satisfaction level in regards to access to food and additional comments contextualizing how their housing status and experience as a transfer student at UCLA may or may not have impacted their rating.  

### Ethics to consider
In developing this "mapplication", ethical problems that could arise include determining what constitutes as "healthy" food options or looking into how accessible the food is based on allergens, religious, or personal accommodations. 

### Who might benefit from this "mapplication"
Looking into local non-profits, one of the most relevant ones is ASUCLA. ASUCLA, or the Associated Students UCLA, is a four-part organization also responsible for the dining and cafeteria options available to UCLA students.
