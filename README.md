# Group ATE | Observations Regarding the Food Prep Storage of UCLA Commuter Students
> A web-based mapplication dedicated to sharing and learning about the experiences of UCLA commuter students who meal prep. Additionally, we hope to share resources to help current and future students navigate the potential struggles of meal planning!

## Objective
Commuter students are denied the option to purchase a meal plan at UCLA, thus causing them to struggle to arrange their own meals while attending classes on campus. Observing UCLA’s limited number of communal refrigeration (storage) and microwave (reheating) appliances, many commuter students cannot independently navigate and prepare their meals. With 43% of UCLA’s off-campus population commuting more than an hour each way, commuter students may stay on-campus late to beat evening traffic (Lopez, LA Times). UCLA’s BruinHub, opened in 2021, provides only one fridge and microwave, and while it serves as a great start to providing resources for commuters, it is difficult to accommodate almost 30,000 undergraduate and graduate commuters (Hallisey, UCLA transportation). Housed in the Wooden Center, students’ meal prep resources are “out of the way of classes” (Rajha, BruinLife). Through our mapplication, we hope to provide a platform for UCLA commuter students to have their voices heard, amplifying their experiences with meal prepping.

## Who is being empowered?
We seek to empower student voices to share their concerns through conducting a community outreach survey of UCLA commuter students to gain perspective on how their experiences as commuters impacts the way they meal prep. The survey aims to learn and understand about UCLA commuter students’ meal prepping struggles, specifically their experiences with food storage and reheating. The mapplication will visualize spatial relationships and patterns, revealing shared experiences of potential inequities regarding the distribution of meal-prep resources across campus. 

By providing meal-prepping commuters with a platform to comment and share concerns of food storage and reheating appliance, students will have a collective voice that can highlight shared issues that are otherwise neglected by UCLA’s main platforms.

## How it can be repurposed
We hope the data from our mapplication will be used by community organizations like cityLAB, the organization that initiated the creation of BruinHub, and other commuter support groups to identify and address the struggles commuters who meal prep face due to the lack of convenient and accessible locations for food storage and reheating, but it can highlight the systemic gaps and inequalities in resource allocation. CityLAB  and other organizations can use the information to advocate for structural changes such as pressuring university administration to prioritize funding for more accessible meal-prep resources and equitable food storage solutions. 

The information on the mapplication would also be accessible to current and future students, empowering them to navigate and demand better food storage spaces on campus. Overall, we hope the project can provide an outlet for the community to share on-campus issues related to meal-prepping food accessibility faced by students who must plan and bring their meals from home.
