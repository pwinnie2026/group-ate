### About this project
This project investigates access to healthy food options for college students, specifically students attending the University of California - Los Angeles (UCLA). 
In developing this "mapplication", ethical problems that could arise include determining what constitutes as "healthy" food options or looking into how accessible the food is based on allergens, religious, or personal accommodations. 

### Who might benefit from this "mapplication"
Looking into local non-profits, one of the most relevant ones is ASUCLA. ASUCLA, or the Associated Students UCLA, is a four-part organization also responsible for the dining and cafeteria options available to UCLA students.
