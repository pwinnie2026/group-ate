                    Commuter students are denied the option to purchase a meal plan
                    at UCLA, thus causing them to face the struggle of arranging their
                    own meals while attending classes on campus.
                    <strong>
                        Observing UCLA’s limited number of communal refrigeration
                        (storage) and microwave (reheating) appliances, many commuter students
                        are left to navigate and prepare their meals independently.

                    UCLA’s BruinHub, opened in 2021, provides only
                    one fridge and microwave, and while it serves as a great start to providing
                    resources for commuters, <strong>it is difficult to accommodate for almost

                    <strong>
                        We aim to empower UCLA commuter students living off-campus by providing a
                        space to voice their comments and concerns regarding available meal prep
                        resources on-campus and the surrounding region.
                    </strong>
                    Our mapplication’s survey and map will be piloted through our AAS 191A class
                    population to assess usability. After piloting, we intend to extend our
                    platform to the wider UCLA commuter population through UCLA’s Commuter
                    Support and Programs office and BruinHub. Specifically, the Bruin Commuter
                    Ambassadors, dedicated towards the development and advocacy of resources to
                    meet community needs, plans large events including New Commuter Student Welcome,
                    Commuter Awareness Day, and quarterly Commuter Breakfast, Lunches, and Dinners.

                    <strong>
                        Naturally due to varying commutes, our respondents’ time and schedules should be
                        respected and prioritized in our survey design.
                    </strong>
                    Therefore, the survey should take no more than 10 minutes depending on the thoroughness
                    of the respondent’s answers. The Commuter Support and Programs office’s newsletter,
                    Instagram, and Facebook Group provide additional outreach methods that allow for
                    consistent, periodic reminders to fill out the survey should students forget or need
                    additional time.
                    <strong>
                        However, we do acknowledge the potential bias a strictly online survey
                        could pose
                    </strong>
                    since there are students that are not as technologically literate, not native
                    English speakers, or have trouble accessing online resources.

                    like cityLAB, the organization that initiated the creation
                    of BruinHub, and other commuter support groups to identify and address the

                    <strong>
                        due to the lack of convenient and
                        accessible locations for food storage and reheating, but it can highlight
                        the systemic gaps and inequalities in resource allocation.
